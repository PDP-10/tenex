
COMMENT Device independent display commands of the display package 
	<TV>DPY, in SAIL source!file format.  


	If you wish to use the package in a SAIL program, include

		REQUIRE "<TV>DPYCOM.SAI" SOURCE!FILE

	in your program.  If you wish to use only the functions of 
	the package but not the names of the command characters as 
	defined in this file, you should

		REQUIRE "<TV>DPY.SAI" SOURCE!FILE.

	The display package is documented in the comments of these two
	files as follows:

	   <TV>DPYCOM.SAI -- (this file) the ASCII characters and the 
			     associated display functions,

	   <TV>DPY.SAI    -- general operation of the display package,
			     TTY, insert, italic, and blink modes,
			     external DPY variables and procedures,
			     annotated example,

	and summarized in the file  <TV>DPYCOM.

	A number of display functions can be performed either by pass-
	ing a command character or string to the display package or by
	calling a special procedure.  Such commands are marked with an
	asterisk (*) in this file and are explained in <TV>DPYCOM.SAI.

	<TV>DPYCOM.SAI uses <TV>DPY.SAI as a source!file.

!		DEVICE INDEPENDENT DISPLAY COMMANDS
!
!	The following commands (characters or strings), when passed to 
!	the display package via the procedures  
!
!	   DPYCHR (char) -- to pass one character,
!	   DPYNCH (n, char) -- to pass  n  copies of a character, and
!	   DPYSTR (string) -- to pass a string,
!
!	perform the following display functions:
!
!
!  NUL =  '00,  ^@ -- Null character
!		Ignored by the display package.

  right = "'01",  COMMENT  ^A -- Move cursor right once (* DORIGH)

		end of bottom line to beginning of top line.
		Clear TTY, insert, and blink modes.

  down =  "'02",  COMMENT  ^B -- Move cursor down one line (* DODOWN)
		From bottom line move to top line, same column.  
		Clear TTY, insert, and blink modes.

  left =  "'03",  COMMENT  ^C -- Move cursor left once (* DOLEFT)
		The inverse of RIGHT.  
		Clear TTY, insert, and blink modes.

  LCA =   "'06";  COMMENT  ^F -- Load Cursor Address (* SETCUR(X,Y))
		Move cursor to the position given by the next two char-
		acters, the first of which is the column  x  and the
		second the line  y,  both in 1's complement.  (Top left 
		corner is column 0 line 0.)  Thus to move the cursor to
		(x, y)  transmit the string  LCA & LNOT(x) & LNOT(y).  
		If  x  (its rightmost seven bits) is greater than the 
		last column number of the display, current column is 
		assumed.  Similarly,  (y LAND '177) > last line number 
		refers to the current line.
		Clear TTY, insert, and blink modes.

!
!  BS =   '10,  ^H -- Back Space

!  HT =   '11,  ^I -- Horizontal TAB
!		Simulate TAB by sending appropriate number of spaces
!		(see SPACE handling below).
!		
!  LF =   '12,  ^J -- Line Feed
!		Move cursor down to next line and clear the line, or
!		scroll if cursor is on the bottom line.
!		Cursor stays in the original column.

!
!  VT =   '13,  ^K -- Vertical Tab
!		Indicate by writing "........" on the next line, move
!		cursor to line below that, and clear the line.

!		is not overwritten with spaces.  Since cursor movement
!		is delayed by the package, spacing over a long distance
!		is fast and spaces (and TABs) at end of line are 
!		ignored.  Action at end of line is the same as for 
!		normal text characters (see below).

!
!  NORMAL TEXT CHARACTERS (ASCII codes '41...'176)

!	1.  If in insert mode, text is inserted in front of the current
!	    character.  Current character and the rest of the line move
!	    right, and characters at last position of line are lost.

!	2.  If not in insert mode, text on the screen is overwritten.
!
!	CURSOR MOVEMENT WITHIN A LINE:  Right by one position.  
!
!	CURSOR MOVEMENT FROM END OF A LINE OTHER THAN THE LAST:  To the 
!	beginning of next, and if in TTY mode, the newly entered line 
!	is cleared.
!
!	CURSOR MOVEMENT FROM END OF LAST LINE:
!
!	1.  If in TTY mode, scroll one line and place cursor to the
