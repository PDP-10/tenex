TITLE	IOSYM -- special variables for random IO subroutines of TV


COMMENT \
	Defining these integer variables in a FAIL LOAD MODULE 
	instead of the SAIL source file makes them normal SAIL 
	variables.  In SAIL we would have to define them using the 
	MEMORY array.  Unfortunately SAIL treats "MEMORY ['123456]" 
	as an array element with a variable index rather than a 
	constant index, generating more code than necessary.

	WARNING:  Definitions in here must agree with those at
		the beginning of file IO (first 4 pages).
