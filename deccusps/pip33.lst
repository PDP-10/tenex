             Assurance.

         2.  Deficiencies uncovered  by  testing  and  SPR's
             received  too  late  for  inclusion  in the DOC
             file.

         3.  Warnings and undocumented  features  users  may

1.0      TESTING

         PIP Version 33 has been tested by Quality Assurance
         to  verify  that  all  major  features  and  switch
         options operate as described  in  the  PIP  manual.
         The  examples  in  the  manual  have been executed.
         Testing has been somewhat superficial- we have  not
         tested  every  use  of every switch or all possible
         combinations.  SFD's have not been tested except by
         the developer.



2.0      DEFICIENCIES



2.1      When copying a binary file to CDP or PTP, user must
         specify  /B even if the extension is one recognized
         by PIP as indicating a binary format file, such  as
         REL.   This  restriction  does  not  apply to files
         copied to disk or DECtape.  Error  message  when  a
         binary file is copied to CDP without /B is:

              ?OUTPUT DEVICE CDP BLOCK OR BLOCK # TOO LARGE



2.2      If a user copies  files  to  or  from  the  generic
         device  DSK,  and  if  there  is a structure on the
         system and in his search list that has no  UFD  for
         his  project-programmer  number, PIP will appear to
         copy the files onto this structure, but in fact the
         data  is lost.  No error message is given.  Problem
         does not occur if a more specific  device  name  is
         given such as DSKB.  When a specific device name is
         used, PIP types an error  message  if  the  UFD  is
         missing.   This  problem also exists in PIP version
         32.



2.3      In the PIP manual  section  2.1.3  (page  2-4)  the
         character  slash has been omitted from the table of
         PIP command string delimiters.   Slash  delimits  a
         switch.



2.4      SPR #6990:  The following sequence  causes  PIP  to
         write  the  directory of the wrong DECtape over the
         user's tape directory:

                                                    -  3 -



          .ASSIGN DTA
          DTAn ASSIGNED
          .R PIP
          *DTA:/D_filename

         The problem is that in PIP  commands  that  require
         both  input  and  output PIP OPENS input and output
         devices simultaneiously on different channels.  PIP
         uses  the  output  device  name for both OPENS, but
         when this device  is  generic  DTA,  monitor  opens
         separate physical devices.



3.0      WARNINGS



3.1      We  encountered  an  interesting  problem,  not   a
         deficiency  in  PIP, when running MPB control files
         that write tape names on DECtape.  If the tape name
         is  enclosed  in  single  ^'s  as  indicated in PIP
         manual (section 3.2.1.2), BATCON converts ^ and the
         character  following into a control character, with
         various undesired results.  In a batch control file
         the tape name must be enclosed in double ^'s:

                   .R PIP
                   *DTA5:^^TEST01^^/X=DSK:*.DAT



3.2      In order to PIP directly to CDP or LPT on a  system
         with automatic spooling of these devices, user must
         .SET SPOOL NO LPT or SET SPOOL NO CDP.  In order to
         execute  these commands he must have bit 200 set in
         his privilege word in ACCT.SYS.  The  use  of  this
         bit is not documented in the REACT manual.
