            the compound expression before the ELSE was encountered.  Therefore,
            BLISS-10 closes the compound expression on  recovery  and  continues

            not a compile time constant expression, it tests to insure that  the

            that of the latest routine declaration.   Since  all  of  the  above
            types  are  referenced via the stack, displays are required in order
            to keep track of the stack reference pointer at outer levels.  Since
            the displays are not available within a routine, it is impossible to
            reference specific stack positions which  are  set  aside  in  outer

            A special unary operator appeared in the text, and was not  followed

            character manipulation functions (SCANN, REPLACEI, etc.). MACHOP not
            in  declarations,  and the special functions SIGN, ABS, FIRSTONE and
            OFFSET.  Since the special unary operators are analogous to function
            calls,  they  require  an  argument  list.   Since  they are special
            functions, there is no machine address  associated  with  the  name,
            therefore, the name alone has no meaning and is illegal.
