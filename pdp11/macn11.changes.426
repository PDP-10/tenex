MACN11 Version 4 is finally ready for Tenex sites.  We have not yet
tested this version in a configuration for DEC systems due to the
scope of its Tenex-related changes.

Version 4 differs from its predecessor in the following ways:


1.  When generated in its Tenex configuration, which is now standard,
    it uses Tenex facilities directly via JSYS's rather than via
    DEC UUO's and the 1050 compatibility package.  This enables
    a much more convenient command dialog;  full length file names
    are legal, including directory names and version numbers, and
    file names can be recognized via the usual escape and ^F
    mechanisms.  If escape is indicated by "$", the following line
    is now acceptable:

	new-version-of-kpm,lpt:<elfcnf.013,<elf>ktb;2,<elf>ksc$,<elf>kpm$

	Completed file names are shown correctly on the terminal
	and the assembly listing;  for example, kpm$ becomes
	kpm.M11;9.

    In the Tenex configuration only one feature of old command dialogs
    is no longer accepted:  directories cannot be identified by giving
    their number in the format of a DEC PPN.  This should be no great
    handicap since the new equivalent is more convenient.

    Another feature available in this configuration is control-Q.
    Typing ^Q while an assembly is in progress causes MACN to report
    where it is in the assembly, giving the pass number, current
    source file name, and source line number.

2.  Cross referenced assembly listings no longer foul up formatting
    of the listing.  It's still necessary to invoke CREF separately,
    however.

3.  Assorted bugs have been fixed in .MEXIT, .NARG, .IFTF listing
    control, and .IDENT.

4.  .PSECT is supported.

5.  Several directives have been added to facilitate writing
    intelligent macros.  These are .NKIND, .NVAL, .IF EQV, .IF NQV,
    and .IF ABS.

6.  "SON", for Source-Oriented page Numbering, has been added as an
    operand of .LIST/.NLIST.

7.  An additional predefined variable, .VRSN., is set to the version
    number of the current source file under Tenex.

8.  Several additional operands can be supplied with the "/FO" switch
    to specify inter-block padding and alignment of packed output blocks
    in the object file.

9.  MACN now supports the "/EQ" switch as defined for MACY11.



Finally, the people responsible for Version 4's changes are . . .

Jim Koda @ ISI, who supplied virtually all of the code unique to Tenex
Rick Gumpertz @ CMU, who furnished many of the other items as well as
		a substantial amount of code that will surface in the
		the next release

Brian Rosen @ CMU
Dennis Smith @ USC-ECL
Steve Casner & Paul Raveling @ ISI
