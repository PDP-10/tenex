		What to do if (when) the eleven craps out
		-----------------------------------------

	All necessary programs live on <PUP>.

1) If the program is still loaded in the eleven, you can restart by loading
   1000 in the switch register, press load adress and start.

2) If the program is not there, you need to reload, so first make sure the
   bootstrap still in core.  If it isn't, reload via the switch register 
   (there is a listing taped to the front of CPU).  The bootstrap starts
   at 77700.

3) Remove the 11 from the interupt chain on the 10.

4) Run <PUP>DBUG11.  No prompts are given by this program.  Type "a", to
   open the 11.  Type "p" followed by "<PUP>PUP11.IMG<esc><esc>"  Note the
   second escape (no idea why this is needed).  Type "b" to start booting.
   The program should print a string of dots.  If nothing happens, try 
   starting the boot again (at 77700) while the program is still trying to
   load.

5) Put the 11 back in the interupt chain, and test things out.

When ever the 11 crashes one ought to save the registers, and the address
at which it crashed. To do this 
	
	a. Halt the processor(the power key must be outof the LOCK position).
	b. ENTER 177700 in the switches (the address of r0)
	   press examine 7 consecutive times recording the 
	   successive values displayed in the lights. These
	   will be r0-r6.

	c. NOW, load the value of r6 into the switches, and press examine.
	   The address displayed in the lights will be the crashed pc+2.
	   Record this and examine again. The next value will be the psw
	   at the time of the crash.
