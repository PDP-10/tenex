First start the memdump on the 11 using the sense switches as directed.
Be sure to put the BOOT FILE NUMBER of the program you want booted 
in ssw before depressing start. An auto boot over the Net is done at 
the completion of the dump.

	NOW USING 2 jobs: (both must be enabled!)
	  1.  Use <schoen>puptst: (The "a" command allows you to build 
	      an arbitrary PUP-caution typing RETURN will send the
	      PUP so don't do that until you are ready. ">" will move
	      the cursor to the next PUP field. If you haven't done 
	      this before, practice before actually trying it for real)

	      BUILD an arbitrary PUP of PUPTYPE 205 to 55#111#23 with 
	      i. ID1 = 152357 (The pass word)
	     ii. ID2 =           socket 0 of EFTP receive server
	    iii. DEST. Socket 0= Net,,Host of EFTP receive server
	     iv. DEST. Socket 1= socket 1 of EFTP receive server

	  2*. Start Eftp receive on host 55#111#23 - enable yourself
	      and force the use of socket 20.
	  3. Now send the PUP you just BUILT by typing RETURN.
	  4. If the PUP was built correctly the EFTP should begin. You can
	     tell if it has by watching the console TTY on the 11 being
	     dumped or running etherwatch on an ALTO-like machine.
	     In the former case, and ! is typed for each 1K words that
	     are dumped.

* When using the PDP10 for the EFTP you will set up (a) as follows:
   (i) (ID1) 152357
  (ii) (ID2) you place 0
 (iii) (dest Sock 0) you place 026523, ie, 55,,123 in 8 bit bytes
  (iv) (dest Sock 1) you place 20
