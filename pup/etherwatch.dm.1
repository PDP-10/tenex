This is a little "how to" use <achenbach>SUZ and <achenbach>eprom
on the Sumex 2020. Together, these two programs allow you to burn
eproms on the eprom burner(EB). To begin with you must power on the 
EB and make sure it is attached to a TTY line from the 2020. Line
5 is preferable which is physical line 2 on the patch board.

You then build a .LDA file on the PDP10 and note the starting address(SA)
used with the /B:xxxxxx switch in LINK11.

After this is done, PUPFTP the .LDA to the 2020 and run MAINSAIL, ie, 
@Mainsail
*<achenbach>suz

will get you going. It asks for the load module name, the starting address,
and whether it is for high bytes or not. You must go through this twice
creating both a high byte file and a low byte file, named for example,
prog.high, and prog.low. After these have been created you must run
<achenbach>eprom TWICE to burn the low and high bytes on the EPROM.

eprom if self explanatory and leads you step by step through burning
the EPROM. Please note that the prom burner requires a 1200 BAUD line
and that line 5 IS 1200 baud. If for some reason you have to use a
different TTY line, make sure you set the proper BAUD rate, and reset
when you are done. the Exec command, i terminal-mode, will show your
current BAUD rate, and the command, term set speed BAUD, will allow
you to change the speed.
