First assemble the source, ie, PUP11.MAC as follows:
@macn11
*pup11,pup11_pup11

Then link the resulting .LDA as follows:
@link11
*PUP11/I/B:1000,PUP11_PUP11/E

[UPPER case is essential above!]

Finally, run <pup>DOC11 to make an .IMG file as follows:

@DCOD11

PDP-11 DECODER / PRINTER.  V 2.1

 LIST OR GENERATE (L OR G)? G

 GENERATE IMAGE FILE.

FROM .OBJ OR .LDA (O OR L)? L
IMAGE BINARY FILE: PUP11.LDA;1
ONTO .IMG OR .DMP (I OR D)? I
IMAGE CODE OUTPUT FILE: PUP11
VERBOSE OUTPUT? N

The resulting output file is PUP11.IMG. This is bootable using DBUG11.
