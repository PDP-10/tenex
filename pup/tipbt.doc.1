Congratulations!  You have obtained the finest in Sumex-AIM PDP11
Ether Reboot (SUPER) PROMs obtainable anywhere!  With care, these
PROMs should provide years of service and engender many hours of
enjoyment.  Before starting to use your SUPER PROMs, please take
a minute to read the directions.

                 Loading your PDP-11 from a TTY line.

Your SUPER PROMs contain a standard TTY boot loader for loading 
IMAGE or BINARY format files generated by MACRO-11 or LINK-11.  Start
your PDP11 at address 170000, and then start your downloader.  Your
program will start ats it entry point, as defined in your code, or the
PDP11 will halt, if no entry point is defined.

                Loading your PDP-11 from the Ethernet

Your SUPER PROMs also contain an Ethernet boot loader (as per Taft,
"Alto Boot Protocol," 1979).  To use it, run your Image or Binary
format file through <PUP>MAKEBT.SAV, producing a file with a name
in the following format: NUMBER-NAME.BOOT, and place this file in the
<PUP> directory on either the KI-10 or 2020 system.  To load your
file, load one of the addresses listed below into the console
switches, press LOAD ADDRESS, load the boot file number of the file
you wish to boot into the console switches, and then press START.  As
with the TTY boot loader, if there is a start address in the file, the
program will start, if not, the 11 will halt.

Ethernet interface with base address 160000: Start loader at 172332
Ethernet interface with base address 160020: Start loader at 172340

                   Dumping your PDP11's core memory

For your conveniance, your SUPER PROMs contain a memory dump program,
using the EFTP protocol.  Start your PDP11 at 172606.  If the booted
file was made with link11, then you an use the program 11ANAL on SUMEX
to analyze the memory dump. 11ANAL requires both the loadmap produced
by LINK11 and the memory dump file created when the 11 was dumped.

When you want to dump the 11's memory you must run EFTP on the system
to which the file is being dumped, and send a special PUP to start
the dumping process. This is described in detail in 11-dump.protocol.
