If you need to BOOT the gateway do the following:
    1. Take the key which is on the right side of the processor on
       the cardboard box, and unlock the cpu.
    2. Halt the cpu.
    3. Load the address 166244 (double check this. This address is also
       listed on the front of the CPU).
    4. Then put 1100 in the sense switches and press start. You can
       watch it boot on the heath. $ means we sent a packet. ! means  
       we received an EFTP data, T means timeout, and R means retransmitted
       the last EFTP ack. Usually you see something like
       $!$!$TT$R$!$!$!$!....etc  If too many TTTTTs happen then you
       may have to restart everything.
    5. LEAVE 1100 in the sense switches. If the gateway crashes it
       does an auto reboot. 1100 is the number of the file on the 2020
       which is booted. If for some reason the 2020 is down, use 1000
       instead which is the same boot file on the 10.
    6. CAUTION: Don't try and boot the gateway when the 10 is loaded
       or the 2020 is running CLASS 0. The EFTP sends on these systems
       sometime hang in these situations. 
    7. LOCK the CPU and put the key back where you found it.
    8. By setting bit 15 while the gateway is running, you can
       get status reports on the Heath every 13 seconds.
       DO NOT leave bit 15 set if you are not intending to
       watch these reports. It slows down the throughput
       considerably to output these, and there are only
       for brief diagnostics...

If you need to restart the gateway. Do 1 and 2 above. Load 1100 and
just start. That is why 1100 is used for the most frequently booted
file, since it is easy to forget to change the boot file number to
the start address number when restarting in a HURRY. So I just use
1100 for everything, but NOT for the same file on different systems.
I have never booted from the 10 since I could boot from the 2020,
since the 2020 is much faster and usually less loaded. The boot
should take about 30 seconds.

If we should have hardware problems with the gateway, then the following
diagnostics reside on <pup>:
    1. xdboard0.lda	This tests the 160000 addressed board.
			It can test the other board by just changing
			its address and placing it in the correct 
			slot on the backplane, ie, where the 160000
			board resides.
    2. xdecho.lda	This is an echo server.

These can only be loaded via a tty line and Nick knows how to do this.
If there are CPU or memory problems, Nick and Bud know of the pdp11
diagnostics on the <pdp11> directory.
