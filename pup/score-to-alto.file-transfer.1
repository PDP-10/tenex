"WALKNET" refers to the transfer of magnetic tapes, in this instance
between SCORE and Altos.  Several command files are used to do this,
all of which prompt for parameters so they are easy to use.
Note that the use of the VAX is provided as a courtesy by the Center
for Integrated Systems and Forest Baskett, and no support is given.

The following procedure works to transfer files between Score and Altos:
	- Log in to the terminal in the Score machine room
	- Assign a tape drive and mount your tape with write ring on that drive.
   For text files (usual case):
	- Type "<SU-NET>DO <SU-NET>WRITE"
	- Enter the drive number of tape used, e.g. 1 for MTA1: and hit return.
	- Enter your input file name and return.
   For binary files (e.g. .press files):
	- Type "SET TAPE FORMAT INDUSTRY COMPATIBLE" and
	- Type "SET TAPE RECORD-LENGTH 1024"
	- Then do a copy command from your file to the tape drive used.

	- Dismount your tape, go to the VAX in 433.
	- Find a free Alto and run EFTP.
	- Type "r" for receive, "vax" for remote host, and an Alto
	  file name for EFTP.
	- Mount your tape on the vax, login as user "to alto"
	- Type the name of the Alto in lower case.
	- Type "t" for text, "b" for binary.
	- Dismount your tape when done, transfer Alto file to the IFS.

The following procedure works to transfer files from Altos to Score:
	- Find a free Alto and run EFTP.
	- Type "s" for send, "vax" for remote host, and the Alto
	  file name for EFTP.
	- Mount your tape on the vax, login as user "to score"
	- Type the name of the Alto in lower case.
	- Type "t" for text, "b" for binary.
	- Log in to the terminal in the Score machine room
	- Assign a tape drive and mount your tape on that drive.

   For text files (usual case):
	- Type "<SU-NET>DO <SU-NET>READ"
	- Enter the drive number of tape used, e.g. 1 for MTA1: and hit return.
	- Enter your output file name and return.
   For binary files (e.g. .press files):
	- Type "SET TAPE FORMAT INDUSTRY COMPATIBLE" and
	- Type "SET TAPE RECORD-LENGTH 1024"
	- Then do a copy command to your file from the tape drive used.
	- Dismount the tape and logout of Score.


VAX users should follow the same procedures at Score, but just access
/dev/mt0 in Unix.  For example, use "tr -d '\015' </dev/mt0" to delete
returns (Unix wants only line-feeds) from the tape.
