
This document describes the boot loader software for PDP11 Ethernet 
stations.  The Ethernet boot protocol follows the protocol described by Ed
Taft in the Xerox document "Alto Boot Protocol."  Boot files are kept as
<PUP>BOOT/FILE/NUMBER-BOOT/FILE/NAME.BOOT (i.e. 1000-ETHGAT.BOOT).
To load a desired file, the PDP11 should be started at the Ether boot
address with the file's boot file number in the switches.  Gateways
traditionally use boot file number 1000 (octal).  Boot files should be 
given numbers of 1000 or greater; numbers below 1000 are reserved by Xerox.

Boot program addresses:

	address			device
	-------			------
	170000			TTY boot 
	171564			Ether boot, board address 160000
	171572			Ether boot, board address 160020

Boot files are created by the MAKEBT program in <PUP>.  A boot file is a 
16-bit file containing the core image of the program in the PDP11.  The
MAKEBT program expects a LINK11 LDA file in either image or binary
format.
